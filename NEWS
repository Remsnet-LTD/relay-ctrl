Changes in version 3.1

- relay-ctrl-allow now communicates the $USER and $DOMAIN variables to
  relay-ctrl-check.  relay-ctrl-send/relay-ctrl-udp don't handle this
  yet.

- Modified the function that creates IP files to first create a new
  temporary file and rename it to ensure the last-modified timestamp is
  updated.

- Added a relay-ctrl-chdir program, to open a directory so the
  relay-ctrl-* programs can inherit the opened FD to fchdir.

- Various portability bugs fixed in the libraries.
